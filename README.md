# Malaria Detection

A machine learning model and GUI for detecting Malaria in a cell.

![A demo of the testing GUI for the Malaria Detection Model](https://github.com/We-Gold/Malaria/raw/master/demo/gui.png)

This project uses tensorflow and keras, including the MobileNet imagenet base.

It achieved an accuracy of ~92% after 5 epochs of training.

## Testing It

To test the model, clone the repo, and then run the gui.py file. Make sure you have the necessary libraries (QtPy5, Tensorflow, Keras, NumPy), and it will open a simple demo GUI.
